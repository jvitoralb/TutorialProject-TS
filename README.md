## Finance Logger

My first TypeScript project, which I did along with a [TS tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI).

My goal with this project was mainly to learn TS, so I used Bootstrap to set up the page quickly and focus on the TypeScript side of the project.

Really enjoyed using TypeScript and probably gonna use it soon again.
